# BEAN  
## Blimp w/ Efficient Autonomous Navigation
Low power robotic platforms, constrained by their small form or long endurance, allow for more capable systems. Small form factors have limited power sources and therefore can only operate for short periods of time. These small robots can be used for warehouse surveillance, medicine delivery, and more. Long duration missions are more efficient if they consume less power and can function longer. These platforms are viable in space and for experimental climate/oceanographic monitoring. Decreasing power consumed by these systems increases mission lifetime. In these small and long duration regimes, the power required for computation and navigation is no longer negligible. 

This repository contains all files necessary to create one of these low power robotic platforms. As part of the MIT LEAN lab, we are pursuing BEAN, a miniature blimp that will use 1 Watt of computation power to 1 Watt of actuation power at 1m/s.

### Motor Config
There are many existing motor configurations for blimp-like UAVs in academia and online. These designs were referenced in the creation of BEAN.

  Typical Quad motor layout
</p>
A typical quadcopter has two pairs of motor that rotate in opposite direction with either CW or CCW props. This allows for yaw control by throttling one pair down. Pitch control is acheived by throttling up forward or rear motors. Roll is done by throttling either the right or left side. Linear vertical motion is done through throttling all motors up or down. This suite of four motors gives dynamic and responsive control of the drone in three dimensions. However, this control doesn't translate well to a balloon. To move in the xy plane through pitch and roll, drone convert some of their vertical thrust to some horizontal. However, most of the thrust is still usually contributed to maintaining elevation. In the case of a blimp, the amount of thrust required to move forward and stay afloat is more comparable, so we would have to tilt quite far to get reasonable x/y acceleration. It makes more sense to assign forward motion to dedicated front-facing motors. This allows for most efficient use of thrust.

</p>
Alvarez presents a lightwieght blimp design in "Evolved Neuromorpic Altitude Controller for an Autonomous Blimp." This design uses two motors and one servo. The motors are coupled to the servo and rotate together. This allows control by tilting the motors in the desired direction. This suite of thrusters gives control similar to a car.

The Georgia Tech GT-MAB is designed for "Monocular Vision-based Human Following on Miniature Robotic Blimp." Their condola has five motors: two vertical, two horizontal, and one sideways. This fifth sideways thruster allows for full three dimensional control.

  Frame of 3 motor blimp config
</p>
Three motor configurations are somewhat common too, especially in the creation of online hobby projects. These designs use two vertical thrusters and one horizontal or vice versa. While giving the same theoretical control as the two DC motors and one servo setup, the imbalance in angular momentum created by spinning up or down the unpaired thruster will create a torque. This could be fixed by correcting with the other motors, but this is more inefficient.

  BEAN CAD with 4 motors
</p>
BEAN has four thrusters, two horizontal and two vertical. This gives control similar to the servo or 3 motor setup, while avoiding the complexity of the servos and unbalanced torque of 3 motors. Because motors are less efficient at higher current, using two motors to produce some thrust is more efficient than one. The extra motor does add weight, but its within the margins.

### Balloon Choice
The main problem with finding a balloon was lack of customizability. Rather than designing the gondola and picking a balloon to fit it, the balloon dictated what  could put on the gondola.

Making a custom envelope would not have been trivial. The material required is hard to purchase online in reasonable quantities and a proper heat seal is vital to operation. Custom making our balloon would also negativily affect repeatibility in future designs.

Finding lift data for balloons is difficult, so we bought standard size party balloon to calibrate testing. The balloon was weighed (no helium), and buoyancy tested. Then the estimated gondola weight as desired lift, found the required diameter for a similarly shaped balloon. The estimated drag on this ideal balloon was calculated to assist in motor selection.

The balloon we chose was the largest one commercially available that has a lift capacity (when filled with >99% helium) of 84.2g. To spend as little power on keeping the blimp airborne as possible, we want our gondola weight to be close to this value. An overall negative buoyancy is desired in case of power failure, otherwise BEAN would just float away.

### Thrust Testing

Thrust testing was performed to determine the most efficient propeller and motor combo. The test stand is shown above. The motor is upside down to keep air from blowing on the scale and disrupting the reading. Also shown is a reasonable selection of propellers of different shapes and sizes that were used in testing. Dashed lines are testing the same prop on different motors of the same size.

</p>
BEAN uses 7x20mm motors with 75mm propellers. From the above graphs, one can see that the 75mm propellers are not the most efficient. However, larger propellers require placement further from the center of the gondola. In the event of a crash, the arms could flex and propellers could cut the balloon or damage a surrounding obstacle. By keeping the propellers close, we maintain a key characteristic of soft robots: safe human interaction. The balloon will bump into an obstacle before the propellers do.

While gear driven propellers would increase efficiency, the added weight of gearboxes exceeded our payload limit. Gear driven motors will be vital in future iterations. 

### Electronics
The computer in use is the Raspberry Pi Zero W 1.1. This is connected to an IMU, power sensor, and 340mAh 1S LiPo. A 5V boost converter steps up the 3.7V input from the battery to power the Pi. Another battery powers the L9110s motor controllers and 7x20mm motors. A second power sensor monitors the rate of power consumption. The Pi-side and motor-side circuits are connected through GPIO pins from the controllers to the Pi, I2C from power sensors, and a shared ground. The full schematic can be seen below.
